# NYC---bikes-analysis

Project for university. We had to draw interesting insights from
NYC CityBike dataset.

≈Åukasz:

I conducted 2 analyses in R:
1. Firstly I took a look at
how did Covid 19 pandemy influenced
travelling by bike. I fetched ride's count and time
from Marches since 2018 to 2022 and presented
them on interactive plots.

2. Other analysis focused on presenting the
number of the bike uses on interactive NYC map
diveded by neighbourhoods.
I created some maps and two of them showed movement
in morning rush hours. From these I could tell which
ones are more residential neighbourhoods and which
ones are more focused on offices and entertainment facilities.

Both analyses were transfered to shiny app.

While working with these project I learned mainly how to create
simple app in shiny, how to create interactive maps in leaflet
and using spatial objects.
